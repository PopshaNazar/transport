A phone object is characterized by the owner's name (String) set at the creation of the respective object. 
A phone also contains an array (possibly with a counter if necessary) that stores the names of phone owners (Strings) who have called that particular phone. 
For simplicity, this array will hold a maximum of 100 elements.

A phone can perform the following operations:

    + call: This method receives as a parameter a reference to the phone object being called by the current phone. Then, it adds the name of the owner of 
    the phone on which the method was called to the name list of the phone given as a parameter to this method. If there is no more space in the array, the 
    call method returns false (indicating that the call failed). Otherwise, the method returns true.

    + numberOfCalls: This method receives as a parameter a String representing a phone owner's name and returns a reference to an Integer object containing the 
    number of calls made by that person to the current phone.

    + toString: Returns a string containing the owner's name and the names of all the people who have called that particular phone.
